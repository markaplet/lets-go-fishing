This data pack attempts to update my mini game "[Lets go Fishing](https://www.planetminecraft.com/project/lets-go-fishing-multiplayer-mini-game/)" to 1.17 mcfunctions. The original was built using command blocks in 1.11 (5 years prior). Overall, the data pack is a mostly 1:1 conversion of the original game.

# Let's Go Fishing! - Holiday Edition

The fish in these parts are unlike any other. Ya see, way up here in the north it's mighty cold. So cold the fish grow wool coats to survive the harsh winter conditions. The "Wool Trout" is an invasive species considered by most fishologist to be an abomination, and advocate for their removal.

HamCrafter Classic is an annual event held around Christmas. Anglers compete head to head trying to catch the most Wool Trout. The angler with the most Wool Trout can win big, taking home the pride and satisfaction of knowing that you're the best, and the ability to gloat and boast amongst your fellow anglers.

## Rules

* Best played on a server with 2 or more players.
* Anglers must stay within their teams allocated casting zone.
* A teams casting zone is defined by the dyed "Wool Trout" pelts on the ground. (wool blocks)
* Players choose teams when they stand on the colored fishing zones.
* Players can play for another team mid-game if they wish, but their score is non-transferable.
* Must use Minecraft 1.17.1
* Have fun

**May the fur be with you!**

## Game Options

In the version, there are only a few implemented options. They are as follows:

## Difficulty

* Easy: Large Adult Wool Trout, Uses the patented CastGrappler™ auto grappling system to automatically (and instantly) real the trout into the scoreing zone.
* Medium: Baby Wool Trout, with patened CastGrappler™
* Hard: Baby Wool Trout and CastGrappler™ is disabled. Wool Trout are not automatically caught. Instead, anglers must reel their catch into the catch zone like a Marlin. This is much more difficult than it seems, but I have managed to catch all 21 Wool Trout in approx ~3 minutes.

## Issues
* Ties are not announced as a draw. Only one team will display as the winner in the title. (WIP)
  
## Todo
### Additional dificulties
* Add harder dificulties such as fish, endermite, chicken
* teleport mode where every 10 seconds the sheep randomize location (maybe spreadplayers?)
