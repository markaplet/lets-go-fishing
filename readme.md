This data pack attempts to update my mini game "[Lets go Fishing](https://www.planetminecraft.com/project/lets-go-fishing-multiplayer-mini-game/)" to 1.17 mcfunctions. The original was built using command blocks in 1.11 (5 years prior). Overall, the data pack is a mostly 1:1 conversion of the original game.

## Todo
* Rename dummy GameState to something better like "state"
* Fix running state. Need to correctly credit the fishing team with the catch
* Calculate team scores and announce winner.

### Additional dificulties
* Add harder dificulties such as fish, endermite, chicken
* Add random effects around course such as levitation and speed
* teleport mode where every 10 seconds the sheep randomize location (maybe spreadplayers?)
